Its latest version, 1.6.1, can be freely downloaded or built from source, and comes pre-loaded with several models, tutorials and a complete on-line documentation.\r\n\r\n***G A M A*** allows to:\r\n* Design, prototype and write models in the GAML agent-oriented language and its optional graphical modeling tool.\r\n* Instantiate agents from any kind of dataset, including GIS data, and execute large-scale simulations (up to millions of agents).\r\n* Couple discrete or continuous topological layers, multiple levels of agency and multiple paradigms (mathematical equations, control architectures, finite state machines).\r\n* Define rich experiments on models and explore their parameters space for calibration and validation.\r\n* Design rich user interfaces that support deep inspections on agents, user-controlled actions and panels, multi-layer 2D/3D displays and multiple agent aspects.",
